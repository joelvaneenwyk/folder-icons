### Windows

To change drive icons:

1. Place the icon and a copy of the `autorun.inf` files in the drive.
2. Open the `autorun.inf` file (with Notepad)
3. Change the `ICON=drive-icon.ico` to the icon's name you are using.
4. Save the file.
5. `Hide` both the icon and `autorun.inf` files so they won't be visible.
6. Reboot for icons to be updated. **Done!**
